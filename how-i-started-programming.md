# How I Started Programming

I’m not a University graduate, and I likely never will be. I have no shame in admitting that. 

Let’s go ahead and talk about how I got the point that I am at today.

## The Beginning
My largest interest when I was a teenager was graphic design, and I loved creating things in Photoshop. However, I always had an inherent interest in programming but could never grasp it correctly. I fucking sucked at programming and my brain just couldn’t understand it. Math was hard, reading was hard, etc.

I took a course in High School learning HTML & CSS. I competed at a state level to try and make the best shitty looking website and my teammate at the time took as many sedative drugs as possible and passed out on the keyboard. What a world.

Anyway, later in high school I tried to take a class on Java, not JavaScript. Java. It was the worst experience of my life because I was trying to teach myself how to code Java but none of it was clicking and it just didn’t make any sense. The way these teachers were teaching me was not working for me. I effectively dropped the class and gave up on programming until I was around age 22.

I’m speculating here but sometimes people don’t fully mature until they’re like 25 and I think I was one of those kids because as soon as I hit 22 things just started making way more sense. How is this possible? Well I got really into game modding and making 3d models, art, and modifying game files for Fallout 4. It was a fascinating world but there was always one key piece missing for me. The god damn programming. I wanted to make mods but I couldn’t fucking code.

What did I do about it? I started banging my head against the wall to learn Papyrus Scripting for the Creation Kit. I wrote a few different small scripts and it started to click.

Then I started wondering if I could write a small application for Dungeons & Dragons. I created user interfaces for rolling dice, doing damage calcs, etc. This was my gateway drug because I used C# and WPF. I built lots of really awful desktop applications that did really basic things. This was enough to get me some fundamentals.

## The Hyper Fixation
GTA:V was released and there was a custom network called GTANetwork. I saw that my favorite San Andreas Multiplayer Server was trying to make a GTA:V server and I had a burning passion to burn them to the ground and try to create my own Roleplay server and beat them to the punch. That’s right, I became hyper passionate about one thing and one thing only. I spent literally 18 hours a day coding non-stop banging my head against a wall trying to build a C# roleplay gamemode. You can still see the old videos on my YouTube still.

I created videos and used it as a medium to explain the work I was doing, and what the gamemode consisted of. I probably wrote about 8 gamemodes across GTANetwork, Rage:MP, and alt:V in total but this has spanned across my entire career up until a few years ago.


This was SO MUCH FUN FOR ME, the instant gratification of seeing things executing in game logic was like digital fucking heroin for my brain. Oh my god it was glorious.

## The Pivot

Eventually I came across Ethereum which led me to Bitshares, and then to EOS. I used EOS as a crutch to learn C++ smart contracts and tried to build an NFT inventory system and embed it into GTA:V. A very pivotal person for my career was this guy Nathan James. He was just this guy on YouTube that made some smart contract tutorials for EOS. I followed them religiously and managed to boot my own blockchain and connect a Smart Contract Wallet to my in-game system.

This was really fucking difficult for me, but it was a confirmation for me that I can do some really hard but impressive things. It all looked like magic at the time.

Anyway, I took some videos of it which I completely regret deleting but I ended up having a recruiter reach out to me on Reddit when I posted the videos and wound up working for [Ultra.io](Ultra.io). They were ambitious and wanted to bind NFTs to video games and make them tradeable.

Reflecting on them now after some discussions with an old colleague the reason that failed was not just because gamers don’t want NFTs, but also because the business proposition gives game developers less money if it allows games to be traded over and over again. Developers did not want that shit.

Anyway, I worked at Ultra for 5 years and mixed it with my work on roleplay gamemodes. I used the two to bounce between hobby projects and actually working in an Agile Environment (Tickets / Issues). This was really excellent to get me up to a professional level and hammer out those soft skills I so desperately needed.

## The Disconnect

When I finally left Ultra, I was making double the income I was before. This was a huge leap in my career, but I was so stressed out that I lost my entire sense of self. I had full on dissociation issues and never actually sat down and tried to straighten out my problems. I didn’t even really respond to my own name anymore, it was pretty awful. It was like seeing myself from third-person at all times. I was existing, but I wasn’t living.

I probably spent a good chunk of the first few months in my job trying to do things but not being able to start anything because I was waiting for people to put together things to do. This is where I determined that my role as a person can never be waiting for instructions. I am a self-guided individual and I carve my own path when I need something to do or want something to work on.


I did some therapy, I did a magic mushroom trip and it helped me re-ground myself as the person that I am and grind out some important things about myself like what I believe in and who I am. Frankly, I still have trouble existing as who I am now, but at least I can code some cool ass shit right? Lmao

## The Lead
Anyway, I worked at this company All in Bits for nearly 2 years but our CEO turned $17,000,000 in $1.5M overnight and it freaked everyone the fuck out. He called me a Coy Poetic Spooky Monkey, a Dimwit, and a retard. Which frankly, if a CEO can turn $17,000,000 into $1.5M I don’t know what to tell you buddy.

However, what I learned while working at this company was more self-care than anything else. It gave me a lot of peace of mind because it made me much more confident in my skillset as a developer and really confirmed I have much further to go in my career and I definitely need to be leading some projects.

I took on a lot of different tasks while at All in Bits including but not limited to wallets, faucets, web applications, and event sourcing systems. All of these things taught me to effectively just pursue whatever I am passionate about and the support will arrive if it’s interesting enough.

## The Work Principles

Eventually, I left All in Bits and this was recently considering the timing of this blog post. I now have a full understanding of what red flags to look for when joining companies. It’s a pretty strong list of criticisms but it’s to protect myself and my dignity before I sell my soul for another contract. I will now try to explain them below.

- No Crazy CEOs
    - These people should be grounded in reality
    - These people should care about other people
    - These people should not call their workers servants
    - These people should not be referencing biblical shit for everything
    - These people should understand what the average American makes
- No Project Plan
    - Nothing is more painful than working for someone who can’t put a project plan on paper
- No Market Fit
    - If a product or company doesn’t have a market fit, and it’s all speculation then it’s a major red flag because the company is likely running off of VC money alone.
    - I took my latest job because there’s a solid shot at the product they’re making.
- No Major Hierarchy
    - The most profitable software company in the world doesn’t have hierarchy. Everyone builds off of passion and passion alone. It’s a pure guiding light to let them experiment and build favorable things for their platform. That company is Valve Software. 
    - I wanna work at Valve so fucking bad.
- Recent Company Restructure
    - A company restructure means that they didn’t like the decisions being made so they cut out everyone that they didn’t like.
    - All in Bits did about 5 of these total.

What’s the takeaway at the end of all of this? I’m not sure but it has been an interesting journey thus far and I’m still really interested in programming but I try to take it easy. I’m still capable of delivering at an abnormal pace but I definitely don’t pull all nighters like I used to.

Anyway, be kind to yourself and let the universe guide you. Thanks for reading.
