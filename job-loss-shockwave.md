# Job Loss Shockwave

Going to be a crazy month as massive job losses are slowly rolled out across the entire United States economy since shipping volume has dropped like a rock.

## Why?

Increasing tariffs across the board for every Country.

We actually had incredible agreements with various countries.

We had... NAFTA and then USMCA between Canada and Mexico.

We had... KORUS FTA.

We had CPTPP which included 11 Pacific Rim Nations.

All of these trade agreements had either free trade among them, or a very small import tax.

You might be thinking, oh yea well I mean we were getting a bad deal! Nothing is free!

Well now you can witness what trade looks like when it isn't free, and the consumers in the United States are going to pay for it in a massive way.

Statistics don't lie and the booking volumes for [US imports decreased by 44.49% from China to the US, and its predicted to be a 20% drop YoY](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-import-bookings-down-64-154541951.html).

What that means from a simpler perspective is that because we are getting less shipments we are going to need less people on the docks, job losses coming.

With there being less shipments to our ports, there is going to be less need for truck drivers.

With their being less truck drivers delivering, there will be less need for workers in UPS, Fedex, and USPS facilities.

This means that massive job losses are coming across the entire United States because **these corporations are going to protect their bottom line**.

Don't even get me started on the [Consumer Confidence Index](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence) which has _plummeted to a lower low than when the pandemic happened_.

## Tariffs who pays them?

The consumers. It's always the consumers. You think corporations are gonna cut their bottom line to pay for imports, no they're just going to increase prices and make consumers pay for them.

Have you been into a Walmart lately? 

They have digital price trackers that allow them to do [surge pricing](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5009271/electronic-shelf-labels-prices-walmart-grocery-store).

These companies don't give a fuck about your wallet, they just want to increase theirs.

If you don't want to read the article about surge pricing, lemme explain it one sentence.

_Well if it's hot outside, we should probably raise the prices of ice cream and water._

## Reprecussions

We're going to see empty shelves across the entire United States as more and more things disappear from the shelves.

One interesting statistic that I read just yesterday is that half of small to medium toy businesses are going to go under this year because of the Tariffs.

We're straight up just going to gut half of these businesses in a single fell swoop.

## The Factories are Coming!

No they're not gonna move their factories here. They'll just keep increasing prices because it will eat away at the middle class, upper middle class, and eventually the millionaires.

These companies want every single dollar they can get their hands on.

The only way you'll get these companies to build factories in the United States is if they are subsidized for their multi-billion dollar factories.

Otherwise, they'll continue to let the consumers take the brunt of the blow because it's still cheaper than building the factories.

[US Citizens want the factories, but aren't even willing to work in those factories](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2024-08/Globalization%20Survey_2024.pdf).

In fact 80% of Americans agree we would be better off with manufacturing here, but only 25% are willing to work them.

Also it's god damn hilarious that the one industry policy we had called the [Chips Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act#:~:text=By%20the%20count%20of%20policy,%24388%20billion%20creating%20135%2C800%20jobs.) would have made over 115,000 jobs in the United States, was completely cancelled by Trump.

## After Thoughts

Save money. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. People are pissed.
