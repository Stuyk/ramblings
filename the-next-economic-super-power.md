# Next Economic Super Powers

There are three people that I currently listen to and try to understand their perspectives when it comes to the markets, and the world in general.

- [Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8)

These people are very much in tune with the world, politics, and data points. Which in a time where you can't consume all content under the sun, it's nice to hear things cut down to a digestable format so that you as a retail investor can look at it and make your own decisions.

I'm probably going to be wrong on some of this, but I'm just looking at the patterns in the world and trying to connect some dots.

## China

While their general market isn't great and there's various collapses happening in China, we as consumers in the US offshored all of our manufacturing to China.

We also offshored all of our knowledge of making these products to China, where now in the US we don't make a god damn thing.

This means that they're going to be a manufacturing super power that is capable of building damn near anything.

They've been around for what... 5,000 years? Betting against China is dumb as fuck.

China is of the mindset that China MUST succeed, and if the population suffers then that's what made that generation great.

They're used to suffering their populations for the empire.

Do not bet against China. Ever.

## South Korea, and Japan

Another trend we're seeing is that these countries are now starting to also work with China. This is something that is very strange because China has always pushed this narrative that other countries should be hated, and we should always see them as enemies.

That tone has changed, and if they're willing to push their differences aside to walk the US off the map as an economic power; then the only economic super power left will be China.

Think about it.

## Europe

Institutional investors are effectively leaving the US Market and going into Europe. 

They looked at the US and basically thought, oh man that's cool that they were protecting us for all of these years but now they've continously elected completely unpredictable politicians for the past 'x' amount of years. 

Which is resulting in uncertainty, but even if Europe puts in the work to make all these trade deals there's no predictability that the deals will stay in place.

Business loves predictability, and in the US we stopped pushing out predictability as a commodity a long time ago.

I partly believe that if Europe is successful in pushing back Russia they will be respected as a new type of power that is shared among all of the European Union.

UK is excluded because they kneecapped themselves by leaving the European Union.

## Canada

I think this one is a bit of a sleeper. I think Canada is actually going to do very, very well in the next 10 to 15 years.

They've rejected America as a whole, and won't even buy US goods as a society.

Due to this, they will build new trade deals with existing powers outside of the US.

They even rejected their far right leaders in a complete upset during their elections.

They are going to go way more moderate, and they will go moderate fast.

I think Canada is going to be a new stable power.

Yes they have a subset of their own issues with rising housing costs and such, but I think they're going to be fired up to prove themselves.

## US

We're likely going to bleed for a very long time. We'll still be a military super power but whether or not we fully reject how far right we've gone is yet to be decided.
