# Information is a Currency

There is nothing more valuable than the digital footprint you leave behind on every single website that you visit.

Even the most mundane browsing behavior reveals more than you might expect.

- Where you are located
- What website brought you here
- How long you stayed
- [What you clicked, scrolled past, or hovered over](https://www.hotjar.com/)
- If you're logged into services like Google, Facebook, etc.

Advertisers and tracking companies can build disturbingly accurate profiles based on your digital behavior.

If your digital footprint is a breadcrumb trail, your real-world data is a map. A map that shows not just where you've been, but who you are.

## What's better than your digital foot print?

A real life footprint.

- How much money you earn.
- Where you live.
- What your social security is.
- What you're investing into.
- What businesses you own.
- Who you vote for.
- What businesses you visit.

I want you to reflect on those bullet points above, because that information does exist it's just safely locked into a government database where nobody could ever access it. Right?

Anyway, a recent whistleblower revealed that [foreign actors even state-backed have attempted to access these databases using valid internal credentials](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security), this was only possible after DOGE changed a bunch of roles and leaked a bunch of data from the database.

Try not to miss the important note in the above article highlighting Russian IPs accessing databases with correct internal credentials but being blocked by IP white lists.

Additionally, [DOGE shared mass citizen data with Palantir](https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/) which directly works with venture capitalists.

## What's next?

If you've read or watched anything about [Techno-Feudalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no), it's a theory predicting a future where corporations and data brokers rule like digital landlords you may recognize the trend: data determines your worth, and the algorithm decides your path.

Socities will be split into these 'patch work company owned towns' where they'll determine where you will fit in best. You will legit own nothing and be forced into becoming a productive member of the 'patch work' based on your skills and contributions.

Think I'm full of shit? Check out the [vcinfo docs](https://www.vcinfodocs.com/tech-fascism-and-infrastructure) which easily highlights with sources everything that is currently happening in the United States and why it's so confusing.
