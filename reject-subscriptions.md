# Reject Subscriptions

I used to be a consumer and someone that didn't mind paying for subscriptions for certain things. Music specifically is going to be the last subscription service that I will remove from my daily life. I'd like to explain how I got to this point and what my tipping point was.

When I was a kid we used to purchase a CD off the shelf, rip it, and then throw it onto our media player of choice. More often than not I was using an Android Phone to push my music to it and start listening. This was a very simple and physical process for infinitely listening to my favorite songs.

The implications of purchasing a CD were that a record label would get a cut, and then the artists would get whatever the leftovers were. This was a pretty dirty process to begin with. Spotify comes along after piloting their application for the first time with Pirated Music. They were successful, and began undercutting the labels.

Every year the price of these subscription services for infinite access to streaming has been increasing to the point where you'll have to forgo an entire fucking meal to listen. 

The artists are paid less, I'm getting less value, and the corporations are getting richer.

Nah, hard pass. This was my breaking point. I'm done subscribing for content. I am going to find more value by taking the time out of my day to purchase the CD. Rip the files. Then throw it onto a media player.

That, or just completely switch to vinyl and play my songs for the next century.

Capitalism is squeezing us dry and I've had enough. I'm done giving evil corporations money. 

Corporations are not people, they are a conglomerate of indentured people slaving over the creation of suppressive technology.

Businesses should build products for each other. Not for the common man. Keep your hands off our escape mechanisms.
