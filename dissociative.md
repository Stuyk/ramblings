# Dissociative

One of the most interesting and difficult times for me was immediately after leaving the company Ultra. I reached a point in my life where it was hard to look myself in the mirror. I could barely stand hearing my own name, and it felt completely foreign to be an actual human being.

What got me there was the working culture that I took on while being at Ultra. I was actively taking on a lot of work at Ultra, and then in my daily life as well. If you are unaware I used to stream daily between 7am-9am on Twitch and then broke into work after that. I would often work until 4 or 5pm and take on as many tickets as I could handle. I was never given the opportunity to really take a break from working. 

I kept pushing myself to the point where all I knew was how to work, and effectively get the mission done.

The result of this was a really brutal realization on the other side that I completely lost my sense of self. I became agitated and the work finally broke me to move away from Ultra as soon as possible. During my final years at Ultra I even started to notice a pattern in my GitHub commits that would help draw a path towards bipolar 2.

I was seeing patterns in my behavior, and I was totally broken. I had been pre-meditating a psilocybin trip for nearly a year as things got worse.

Terrence McKenna was a larger influence on who I listened to in order to understand what I was about to get myself into because what I was certain I needed to 'kill myself' in order to come out alive on the other side.

When I finally got a hold of the materials and pulled the trigger it was nothing short of a miracle to re-establish myself as a person. I had never been humbled by anything so severely and it changed my perspective on life for the better.

Thus, I present to you what I experienced during my trip `2 Years Ago` and what it taught me.

## The Trip

My intention with this journey was to feel and explore the more spiritual side of life. Wife used Sage, and Palo Santo to cleanse the room and my body and talked only of good experiences and happy thoughts. While I am not much of a ‘crystals’ person she placed clear quartz at each entrance such as windows, and doors to ensure nothing negative would enter the environment. If anything it was a peace of mind thing to give the best possible environment and numb the senses. We dimmed the lights down, we hid all smells or any smells, and that allowed me to focus on myself for the trip.

We set up a small ‘shrine’ where there were a handful of rocks, a brown chalice-like cup, and the 3.2G (3200mg) of Golden Teacher strain mushrooms as little dissolvable pills. I had lemon water in the cup to help calm down any reactions to the mushrooms in my stomach. I took the pills, chugged my water, and turned on a guided breathing exercise from Wim Hof for 11 minutes.

After finishing the breathing exercise I laid in bed for a little bit and waited. I didn’t fast for this journey so the effect took between 45 minutes to an hour to hit. However, before the effect hit I made sure to play some [ambient music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXdf43Md5h6cE?si=3f8c11d94038485b) for the come up. About 30 minutes after taking the pills I went to the kitchen and grabbed some barbecue chips and nervously got them down. I periodically closed my eyes and cupped my hands over them to see if something visually in the blackness had changed. Eventually around that 45 minute to hour mark is when I started seeing some visual changes in the black.

I used that as my sign to put on the headphones, and put my blindfold on. Additionally, I switched over the playlist to a mix of [Jon Hopkins Music for Psychedelic Therapy, and Music for Mushrooms](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3BCwZBy0fe28SxyLRDc3xq?si=c68b63f281094cea). I also put in water and ocean waves at the start of the playlist, and in between albums. I think this helps set the tone and consciously remind myself that I can take a break.

Before reading everything below, I will state that everything that I felt during this experience gave me pure emotional release. I cried through the entire journey with tears of joy. The entire mask was soaking wet, and the tears just kept coming and never stopped.

The feeling that I got during the journey was a loss of time, and when I started that playlist with the ocean waves I felt it slowly washing over me and letting my nerves go a bit to just accept the feelings. The first song in the playlist has a very interesting sound but it sets your body to start dissolving its current feelings, and accessing whatever part of the brain is letting you see the visual imagery with the blindfold on.

The come up for the journey was amazing because what it did was shower me with music and wash away all of the ‘dirt’ and ‘bad feelings’. However, what I found out is that it washed me down the drain and I was dirt. There was a set period of time where I was on the ground and there was nothing that I could do. I could see various bits of light and movement but could not see anything from my perspective. Nothing human, but light noises, and sounds. All I did was become useless, or so I thought.

I was scooped up into a firework and became gunpowder. When the firework was lit I experienced pure joy as I was burned into the air and exploded. It was a very bright flash of white. I floated back down to the ground and became dirt once again. I believe this was my ego death experience, and that the journey absolutely sent me off with a bang.

Now, during the firework scene it gave me my first lesson. Which effectively told me to **celebrate more**. Whether that’s the smallest achievements, my own birthday, or life itself. The world is a wonderful place and even the smallest granular of things we can see should be celebrated for what they can do.

After floating down from the air, I was floating through the wind and felt truly weightless. My entire body had dissolved and it was purely my consciousness and whatever the strain of mushrooms was willing to teach me. I floated back down into the ground and once again became dirt.

I was buried under ground and eventually I started getting pushed through the ground at a rapid speed. I eventually found myself floating in space where I could relax and freely float. There was a small moment where my consciousness said that if I’m in space then I can’t breathe. I held my breath for a moment but then told myself to just breathe. Everything happened normally and I floated in space for what felt like hours.

Eventually it brought me back down and gave greater meaning to the final song in the first album which was called **Sit Around the Fire**. Effectively what I experienced was another lesson that told me that **when you’re an ember and you’re at your lowest sometimes you need to fan the flames a bit to be reborn again**. You never really lose your sense of self, but you lose the ability to feel. What you can feel can be dulled down and forgotten when you’ve ignored yourself for so long. I felt the flame inside spark up again and it told me that there is a lot of love that I can bring to the world. I just need to show it more and let my feelings do the talking.

At this point the water sounds came in and I used this time to go to the bathroom. I also used it as a way to understand what the trip felt like in a conscious visual state. Made my way to the bathroom and busted up laughing because apparently peeing is the funniest feeling in the world.

I laid back down and set myself up for the next journey. At this point is when I started to consciously ask questions in the form of, ‘teach me about…’ and that’s when I started getting some really interesting insights. Now I do not know if they are true but I will try to explain them to the best of my ability.

There is a level of consciousness that expands across all planes of existence. Our brains are only able to process so much information, but these planes of existence are not accessible in normal circumstances. Think of hundreds of thousands of layers of realities that are little squares and evenly spaced apart. They’re like the floors of a skyscraper. When I asked to meet my wifes mom who is deceased, the journey humbled me and showed me a building with all of her planes of existence and then crushed it into nothing. She was gone and there was nothing I could do to try and meet her for the first time. Being numb to the feeling of death and never truly feeling it, it became an overwhelmingly sad experience. It is a soul crushing experience and watching a piece of life disappear in the blink of an eye is a heavy experience.

It helped me understand that **death is a final destination and the building which you constructed will eventually be reduced to ashes just like everything else.** Which to me seems like our bodies are just a vessel to build a complex fleshy machine.

Now, the next question that I asked was for it to teach me about what more I could do for my family. It showed me a simple visual of just well… hugging more. Hug more and love your family. I even asked what more I could do for my wife and it just told me to love more as well. It was a simple message and nothing extravagant about it.

Now during each question I started to notice a pattern that as I asked these questions with consciousness it would reply to me in the form of music. I was literally talking with the music and understanding what it was telling me. It was a truly surreal experience and it cannot be described unless you feel it yourself.

I was also caught up on my experiences in life that I missed from a ‘feeling’ standpoint. It took me back through the birth of my child and I got to witness her growing up again, and the energy from both of our bodies being mixed into a hurricane-like structure in golden glowing bliss to form our child. It gave me an understanding that kids are little hurricanes of energy and there are different sides to every storm. Sometimes the storm is ravaging and destructive, and sometimes it’s calm and content. Their little brains are unable to understand anything that is happening so it sways from one extreme to the other like a little pendulum until they reach consciousness.

Finally the last thing that I asked during my trip was **how do I reach a higher level of consciousness** and funnily enough it laughed in my face. It pushed everything aside and was effectively like, “You’re fucking seeing this shit right?”

Then I came down from the highest part of the journey and was able to consciously see again. I grabbed my wife and we reconnected and talked about the experience. Although it was really difficult to explain it in full because they were still in full effect.

I think one thing that was truly astonishing is that after pulling the blindfold off the world felt truly beautiful. Everything was vivid, and even the smallest things were like little beautiful paintings in extreme detail. My takeaway from this is that the world's best painters who spend hours on details and every individual brush stroke do it with purpose. 

One cannot truly appreciate the beauty that is this world.

* Eat better to clear the brain fog
* A lot of your frustration is linked to your voice not being heard
