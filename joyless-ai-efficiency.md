# Joyless AI Efficiency

Artificial Intelligence ruins the joy of software engineering for passionate programmers.

There is nothing more uplifting than putting on a playlist that matches your mood and hammering out various software problems over a few hours. Just like performing a musical piece on an instrument, programming can sometimes feel like you are doing a performance for yourself. Every bit of your brain is carefully working together to construct and solve complex problems through pattern recognition.

When Artificial Intelligence enters the picture you lose the magic that is performing to create your own masterpiece.

- You stop performing
- You stop composing
- You stop being creative
- You stop critical pattern recognition
- You stop loving

AI is an interesting tool for boilerplate code, small problems, and establishing a feedback loop for you to consider edge cases.

Think about the repercussions of using too much AI.

Those who tread too deep may lose a type of mental therapy they used to enjoy.

If we stop understanding AI, then we will lose AI.
