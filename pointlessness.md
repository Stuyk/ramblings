# Pointlessness

As I've aged I think one thing that has significantly had an impact on my life is the pointlessness of everything. Everyone is selling you something at every waking hour of their lives. Each individual video, tv show, movie, etc. are all trying to get you to want something specifically. Every business is trying to sell you a product which you likely don't need.

I'm starting to believe that a fundamental truth for successful businesses is being able to build everything in-house without relying upon other businesses. This means that the entire business is driven by their own success, their own people, and their own talent.

This still doesn't change the fact that everyone and everything is foaming at the mouth for your attention at any given hour. I've felt less and less inclined to even give my attention to anyone or anything without weighing the pros and cons first. This has made my life exponentially less relaxing because I can't just sit down and watch a movie without overthinking it.

It's a difficult place to be as I'm often times surrounded by others who are vicious consumers of everything that they see. There's a cake on tv, I better buy myself a cake. That character has a really nice laptop, I should get myself a really nice laptop.

It feels like the world has become an advertisement board and nobody can just exist in the moment. I'm likely to abandon my cell phone in the near future because even my screen time has gone down significantly. Which used to be pretty bad with social media on my phone but now I'm averaging around **45 minutes A WEEK**.

A significant portion of my day is already sat in front of the computer which allows me to shut it down, and walk away. There isn't really a takeaway from this article, it's just pointless reflection into my own soul and what drives me as a person and creator.

Speaking of creations I've pretty much abandoned the idea of becoming any kind of video based content creator. The entire platform is soul sucking and the constant push to get you to make slop to be blessed by an algorithm is some technoligarchy bullshit. If there is anything for me to make in the future it's because nobody else has put together a comprehensive video on the subject. 

There's a musician and creator named [Ben Jordan (Flashbulb)](https://www.youtube.com/@BennJordan) who has the right amount of 'tism to make absolutely brilliant videos about difficult subjects.

Anyway, this place is a fucking nightmare.

Try not to worry about what everyone else is doing.
