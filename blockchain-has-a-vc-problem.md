# Blockchain has a VC Problem

Blockchains are interesting technology and I've been wondering why new projects are struggling so hard to actually get traction and userbases for their chains. Recently, I caught up with the blockchain lead at a Ultra.io [Adam Du](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-d-7aa5b270/) and we both reflected on our time at the company. This is something that I like to do frequently to gather perspective on where things went wrong.

One of the most interesting problems with blockchains that are launching today is that more often than not they vest their tokens for venture capitalists. What this means is that 2 or 3 years down the line a certain amount of tokens are unlocked for the VCs to claim and then sell on the market. Which basically means that as your project is just about to become successful, the VCs decide to dump their tokens and reclaim the money used to fund the project in the first place.

The result from this is the project will usually crash almost instantaneously and eventually slowly bleed out.

## Ultra's VCs

Here's a chart of a Ultra's token and I would like you to take a guess when VCs dumped their stack.

## QANX's VCs

Here is another project which is funded by venture capitalist. This is QANX, and they had a funding round in 2021, and 2023. You can literally see where the VCs are taking their cut.

## Conclusions

I'm only showing two charts here and I am certain there are many other projects out there but I believe that the most successful projects that could exist out there cannot be funded by venture capitalists. They must be raw projects where humans are starting from zero.

If you want your blockchain project to be successful, then you need to start it from zero.

Fund it yourself, or build a community of interested people who want to put everything on the line.
