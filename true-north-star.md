# True North Star

In life we are given a set of cardinal directions such as North, South, East, and West. These general cardinal directions describe a fundamental truth about a direction on earth. However, as many of us navigate through our lives we find ourselves seeking validation and direction. Which effectively amounts to the fundamental question of what is the meaning of life?

My meaning in life is not to find a fundamental truth among all of those seeking purpose. I think the meaning of life for me is to follow my True North Star. Which I can aptly describe as a decision that is based on the path of least resistance. These decisions are backed by fundamental truth such as science but it's a feeling of whimsy and magic that guides the direction.

Writing it out, it seems almost entirely illogical to put these words together but I think there's more to it than what is at face value. A gut feeling will make you avoid walking down an alleyway, but a logical understanding is that you leave the public eye in a alleyway. We find safety in numbers. The bridge between the logical and illogical is the Truth North Star.

For myself specifically, entering a job interview and feeling existential dread through a screen is a gut feeling. Especially when the interviewer appears to have their soul being sucked out of them. Whereas the feeling of an excellent interview coming before it has even happened is that feeling of whimsy and magic.

This may take some time to understand or even find your own true north star, but when it does appear it will feel as if you're the luckiest person in the world. When you dance with the universe, you should try your best to listen and not lead. 

Ask yourself a simple question, where are WE going?
