# Navigating Tech Careers with Bipolar 2

Navigating programming while going through manic episodes or plunging into deep depression is a careful balancing act. 

I think this is more of just a bunch of notes that I think could be useful to those who share similar patterns to myself.

## Learn how to Learn

One of the coolest super powers of this disorder is when you're manic and you can harness those sleepless nights your ability to learn goes through the rough.

If you can find a way to channel that energy strictly into learning, and banging your head against a wall until you get results; it will change you forever.

I often overthink every detail and have dozens of ideas floating around my fleshy skull.

What you should do is figure out the best methods for your learning process. 

Put down that video game and dopamine distractor and channel it all into watching videos, writing, or listening.

## Brain Fog Ebbs and Flows

You may or may not have this experience but there are times every few months where a fog completely takes over my brain.

Audio processing becomes more difficult, and listening to people talk is overwhelming.

I like to think of this time period as the gradual crawl.

You need to keep crawling forward regardless of how your body is feeling.

Crawling through the fog even if it's mentally exhausting will get you to the other side eventually.

## Sleepless Nights

One of the side effects of Bipolar 2 is that you'll get less sleep. You will think this is just insomnia but it's just your circadium rhythm being off.

What you can do about this is either

A. Take low doses of Melatonin
B. Take Benadryl

You really need to make sure that you're getting as much sleep as possible.

However, some nights will be way more intense than other nights and your brain just won't shut the fuck up.

Try to sleep for just a little bit but give up after 30 minutes and channel all of that energy into learning and building something.

## Be Okay with Good

You cannot sit down and perfect everything that you write.

You will often times forget what you have worked on and even sometimes forget how you even wrote something.

You can leave yourself some comments that speak to you in your code bases, documentation, and other places.

You need to be able to look at those comments and use them as a note to yourself to help you re-align with your overall vision.

Even if the item is not perfect, pushing something out is better than never pushing anything.

Stop tweaking the creation and push it out for feedback.

## Manic Ideas

When you're manic your mind will never stop racing and it will be impossible to shut it down.

One of your only options is going to be writing those ideas down, and acting upon them.

The ideas that persist over the next few days are going to be your best ideas.

Try to act upon them before your manic episode ends.

## Do the Minimum

Due to how you behave on a day-to-day basis you can't consistently push out results every single day of your life.

Your entire psyche goes completely against the modern work day.

You need to find a job that respects your time and lets you cool off and work in bursts.

Obviously there is the day-to-day work that needs to get done but try to avoid places that push Agile on to their developers.

You pretty much have to get yourself to the point of being completely autonomous in every system that you're placed in.

You need to be your own Staff Engineer before being given the title.

You are a builder, not a maintainer.

## Everything is Wrong

You are going to constantly have this nagging feeling that everything is wrong in the world.

It could be the way you're writing, the way you're coding, the way you're interacting with people in general.

That's literally because your entire system is working in overdrive all of the time.

You can't really tune in with anyone or anything to get a better read on any given situation.

It gives you a unique perspective and lets you really dig into all aspects of technology and how things are done.

However, in most cases it's better to ride the waves than challenge every intricate detail.

Pretty much shut the fuck up and get the work done, you'll have your time.

## Your Hobby is Your Career

Whatever you hyperfocused on being good at is probably what you're going to be the best at.

This could be anything from writing, coding, and designing.

The problem is that we like to overachieve and be good at everything we're given.

We need to tame those wants and urges and try to generalize into a few areas.

If you like writing you should become a developer advocate or developer relations.

If you like coding then you can probably go down the traditional paths for programming.

If you like designing and coding you can probably make some great frontend designs.

If you like everything you can probably do alright as an indie developer, but you should probably build a career before you fully pursue your 'dream game' and make stupid decisions like quitting your job. 

Then putting it all in on a game about a sword wielding pig who rides a chicken and platforms across a colorful world and you make it mobile only. 

Not talking from experience here but your idea is nothing until you wear the marketing hat long enough.
