# Economically Rigged

I was originally going to write about my different money principles but now my perspective has changed much more than ever before.

Let's start with one of the most interesting topics.

## Dark Pools

Dark pools are basically the Wall Street equivalent of a private exchange that only big money is allowed to participate in.

50% of exchanges are now in dark pools.

What this means is that all the big money like billionares and corporations get to set the prices of all stocks.

The retail traders are given at best sloppy seconds to their pricing.

All stock prices are now fake, and if you believe they're real you're incredibly naive.

## Inflation and Quantitive Easing

When inflation and quantitive easing occurs everyone gets a little more money. However, now everything costs a bit more.

Not everyone is given a 'little more money' which results in various working class people being screwed over.

Depending on your sector, who you work for, etc. you're often getting a pay cut because they do not account for inflation.

## Tariffs

These are really funny and a lot of people misunderstand how tariffs work. 

If you don't think corporations are going to eat the cost of Tariffs and not pass the pricing on to you, you're incredibly naive.

Anyway, so when a company imports something from another Country they initially pay the taxes to import it.

Then they just raise the price of the product they imported and pass that new price on to you, the customer.

Tariffs fix nothing, they just make life more expensive for everyone and suck more money out of every day working class people's pockets.

## Property Taxes

Congratulations, you just bought your first home. 

You'll now be responsible for not only paying for the financing but also there's this cool hidden fee where when you're done purchasing your home you'll have to pay for property rights.

What happens when you don't pay for your property rights?

Well, someone will eventually come along and pay all those property taxes for you! Then they can just take your home.

You own nothing.

Many states allow for tax lien sales, where a third party can pay your overdue property taxes in exchange for a lien on your property. If unpaid this results in foreclosure.

## Social Security

You're paying into a system until about 2034 and then we'll be completely out of money in our social safety net for the elderly.

This system specifically requires newer generations to continue paying into it for it be worthwhile.

However, we are now fully aware that social security is absolutely going to go away and there is no retirement income for a large swath of American citizens beyond 2034.

This is going to be an epidemic because we're playing musical chairs with people's lives.

## Retirement Homes

A majority of retirement homes are also now owned by the ultra wealthy, investment firms, and private equity.

This means that they get to make the rates for everyone who is retiring which effectively transfers all wealth you may have gotten straight into the pockets of the ultra rich.

If you want to pass on generational wealth, you're better off dying or completely exiting the United States as soon as possible.

## To Be Continued

I have more to write and more topics to cover but this is just the beginning.
