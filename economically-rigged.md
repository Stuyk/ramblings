# Economically Rigged

I was originally going to write about my different money principles but now my perspective has changed much more than ever before.

Let's start with one of the most interesting topics.

## Dark Pools

Dark pools are basically the Wall Street equivalent of a private exchange that only big money is allowed to participate in.

50% of exchanges are now in dark pools.

What this means is that all the big money like billionares and corporations get to set the prices of all stocks.

The retail traders are given at best sloppy seconds to their pricing.

All stock prices are now fake, and if you believe they're real you're incredibly naive.

## Inflation and Quantitive Easing

When inflation and quantitive easing occurs everyone gets a little more money. However, now everything costs a bit more.

Not everyone is given a 'little more money' which results in various working class people being screwed over.

Depending on your sector, who you work for, etc. you're often getting a pay cut because they do not account for inflation.

## Tariffs

These are really funny and a lot of people misunderstand how tariffs work. 

If you don't think corporations are going to eat the cost of Tariffs and not pass the pricing on to you, you're incredibly naive.

Anyway, so when a company imports something from another Country they initially pay the taxes to import it.

Then they just raise the price of the product they imported and pass that new price on to you, the customer.

Tariffs fix nothing, they just make life more expensive for everyone and suck more money out of every day working class people's pockets.

## Property Taxes

Congratulations, you just bought your first home. 

You'll now be responsible for not only paying for the financing but also there's this cool hidden fee where when you're done purchasing your home you'll have to pay for property rights.

What happens when you don't pay for your property rights?

Well, someone will eventually come along and pay all those property taxes for you! Then they can just take your home.

You own nothing.

Many states allow for tax lien sales, where a third party can pay your overdue property taxes in exchange for a lien on your property. If unpaid this results in foreclosure.

## Social Security

You're paying into a system until about 2034 and then we'll be completely out of money in our social safety net for the elderly beyond those who have already claimed.

Basically get in now before it's too late, if you're old.

This system specifically requires newer generations to continue paying into it for it be worthwhile.

However, we are now fully aware that social security is absolutely going to go away and there is no retirement income for a large swath of American citizens beyond 2034.

This is going to be an epidemic because we're playing musical chairs with people's lives.

This could be totally solved by taxing the ever living fuck out of billionaires.

## Retirement Homes

A majority of retirement homes are also now owned by the ultra wealthy, investment firms, and private equity.

This means that they get to make the rates for everyone who is retiring which effectively transfers all wealth you may have gotten straight into the pockets of the ultra rich.

If you want to pass on generational wealth, you're better off dying or completely exiting the United States as soon as possible.

## Credit Scores

Credit scores are effectively the banks way to score you for how much money they're going to make off of you.

When you have a higher credit score you're likely going to have a lot more income to spend on their interest payments.

Which means the banks are making a killing off of your interest payments.

## The Poor Tax

Did you know that in the United States it's more expensive to be poor?

You may be thinking that's the most bizarre thing I've ever read, but lemme explain a bit.

1. When you miss a payment on a loan with interest, you pay more interest.
2. When you have $10 for the week and you need a bar of soap you can't go buy the cheaper bulk pack. Instead you buy the dollar store bar of soap that charges you more. That's what you need at the time.
3. Ever miss a rent payment, or miss multiple rent payments? They just kick you out and make it way harder to get a place to stay. You may even have to stay in a day-to-day motel.
4. When you miss payments on any bill your credit score gets dinged, and it makes it impossible to get a loan for a vehicle.
5. Did I mention that in the US you need a vehicle to live? You're better off moving to a city with high walkability and better transit if you're poor.

Don't even get me started on the fact that when you are in poverty you live in poorly maintained areas which shift your everyday needs elsewhere.

You start having to think about who is around you, am I going to be safe, am I going to make it through the week, what can I put on the table for my kids, etc.

## Taxes are Rigged

Yes, you heard that right. The tax system is rigged so badly that the working class is constantly paying into the government and the rich hardly pay a dime.

Did you know that the rich used to pay upwards of 80% of their income up until the 80s?

That's why America was thriving back then. It was because we taxed the shit out of the rich and passed it on to infrastructure and made people's lives better.

Here's some bullet points.

- Low-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in state and local taxes compared to the wealthy. The poorest 20% pay around 11.4%, while the top 1% pay only 7.4%
- Sales taxes, payroll taxes, and property taxes disproportionately impact the poor since they consume a larger share of their income, while the wealthy benefit from tax loopholes and lower capital gains rates
- The richest Americans benefit from lower tax rates on investment income, allowing them to pay a lower overall tax rate compared to many working-class individuals
- The rich use the strategy called buy, borrow, and die. This allows them to buy stocks, real estate, or businesses. Then they borrow from the banks against those assets. Loans aren't taxable income. Then they die and do what is called 'step-up in basis' meaning any gains made during their lifetime are erased for tax purposes. The rich will always get richer.

## To Be Continued

I have more to write and more topics to cover but this is just the beginning.
