# Connection

I've been trying to figure out how to word this for a long time but if you know me as an actual person you may notice that I don't have very many people in my life. I am an extreme recluse and that is because I don't like being put into vulnerable positions for exploitation. I often appear as this shy individual who has nothing to offer to a conversation.

I'll give you some clarity on why I am the way that I am today. Throughout my entire life I was never heard or listened to by my parents and the people around me. Nobody cared what I had to say because I was just a kid who liked computers that lived in the middle of the desert. I have few joyful experiences but nobody quite understands me like my computer does.

If you want to actually make a connection with me it requires meeting me where I am. I don't want to talk about the weather, or how things are going for the family. I want to have the hard conversations that challenge world views, and change your mind. Those are the conversations that enforce connection for me.

I love to talk about the theories and ideas revolving around how the world exists. 

How it currently exists. 

What is beyond space.

What life could be like without systemic oppression.

To quote a friend and colleague

> You are limited by their imagination and dreamers like you and me can't fucking deal with that.

I want to fucking dream. I want to challenge idealogies and build.

Let's talk about the machine elves that exist in DMT trips.

Let's talk about the stars.

I want to repurpose fundamental mechanisms on the internet and shine new usecases upon them.

I want to go beyond space.

I want connection.
