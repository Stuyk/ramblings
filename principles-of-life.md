# Principles of Life

These are just a handful of principles that I believe about myself and the world around me.

Some of them are rude, and some of them are insightful in how I act.

## Teach for Enjoyment

Teaching how to do something is a net-zero gain, and always will be. If you enjoy writing about a specific topic or just want to share knowledge don’t expect to get anything out of it. 

Teach for the love of teaching rather than for the capitalistic gain.

## Learning is Hard

When it comes to learning new subject matter, programs, or even just how to do something new most people are incapable of doing so.

They'll often give up after the first week and aren't conditioned enough to fail over and over again.

Don't try to push your teachings on to these people, offer them guidance but stop checking in because they've likely already given up unless they say otherwise.

## Anger

Anger often lets me retreat into my mind and think about the situation further and try to understand what is going on. 

Screaming, yelling, and pushing anger onto another human being will solve nothing. 

Stop what you are doing when you are angry, step away, and come back with a solution or compromise to make the situation move on as fast as possible.

## Maintain Relationships

It’s difficult to be social and it’s often very uncomfortable to be social. 

However, having some form of social relationships with a given few families is beneficial in that it creates a community. 

Build relationships to form a community and rely upon one another for social gatherings.

## Over Consumption

When you cannot control how much you eat it’s best to simply not invite snacks such as chips and soda into the household. 

Simply by not purchasing them you will avoid them.

## Consumerism

Buying that next item will not make your life any better than it was today. You will eventually be able to purchase whatever you want and it won't make your life better in any way.

The most important items in life are the ones that will help you create, build, and exercise your mind in ways you may not be aware of.

I'm a proponent of practical items are the best items to have around.

If you're curious what I would consider practical items here's a small list.

- Computer
- 3D Printer
- Hydroponic Grow Towers
- Screw Driver, with replaceable heads

## Weight Loss

Your mouth is what makes you gain weight. Stop putting stuff in your mouth and you'll suddenly start losing weight.

Some people can never lose weight because their body just won't let them. Which they'll need additional help to get over that hill.

This pretty much comes down gut biome, and some of these processed foods truly just prevent people from really losing weight without actual medicinal help.

There are a lot of ‘methods’ in this world but almost everyone is trying to sell you some form of methodology, a book, or other garbage. What actually works is simply limiting calorie intake. This can be done by stopping eating earlier at night, and then avoid all meals up until lunch time or mid afternoon. Instead of a heavy lunch meal opt for a smoothie, or something with lower calories.

Weight loss can be pushed further with exercise and consistent habits.

## Sugar is Poison

Limit your sugar intake, it's not worth the time to fill your daily calories with sugary drinks, snacks, and other other sugary treats. 

Sugar is a slow killer, and only natural sugars from fruits should be introduced into your diet.

Don't expect yourself to be perfect, and treat yourself once in a while.

Just decline everything else so that when you have some sugar it's limited.

If it's out of the house, it's out of your mouth. Period.

## Drugs and Alcohol

While having a drink once in a while during a social outing is good lubricant for conversation one should strive to never have more than one drink. One is enough to get talking, and two is enough to overstep boundaries. I can't even have alcohol because it can potentially send me into a manic episode.

Marijuana is unfortunately can be linked to agitation, anger, and can potentially make you stupid as fuck if you do it too early. If your family has mental health issues there's a very good chance you can onset psychosis issues by taking this substance. You've been warned.

Caffeine can cause irritability as well and should be avoided where possible, but for some people who have ADHD it can be used as a way to calm down their brain. We should be limiting ourselves to a single serving of coffee per day for the health benefits, but most of us can't handle that. Also if you're putting sugar in your coffee you're negating its effects.

Not all drugs are bad and some of them can be incredible for certain individuals.

As a general rule of thumb this is what you need to know about the dangers of drugs.

1. If you sniff it, it’s terrible for you
2. If you inject it, it’s even worse
3. If you smoke it, it’s going to line your organs and cause other issues
4. If your family has any form of psychosis then you're playing russian roulette with 5 bullets in the chamber.

Listen to science, and research a drug heavily before even considering taking it. You will want to ask other people who have experienced it how they feel about it. What their experiences are.

In almost all cases you will want to avoid drugs.

## Voting

Vote to enable others to have a happier life. If one party is restricting the rights of humans in another party then vote against that. The rights need to be based around the human body and not objects. 

Nobody should be restricted from doing whatever they want with their own body.

You should not be voting for anyone that is doing anything in the name of Religion. Government and Religion should be considered separate entities and they should **NEVER BE INTERTWINED** .

Vote against the rich. We're talking billionaires, trillionaires, and anyone that makes substantial amounts of money. They should be taxed until they're living the life of the common man.

## Making Money

Everyone is trying to sell you their quick scheme to make money fast. Look, if there was a way to make money fast we would all be rich. There are a few ways you can actually make money and do it on a consistent level but it takes capital to make capital. Here are the ways to make money

1. Work
2. Run a laundromat or self-serve services like car washes
3. Create things and sell them
4. Baking
5. Artwork
6. Music
7. Sounds
8. Build up enough income by saving to buy stocks that give dividends
	1. Dividends pay out every 3 months usually and reward share holders for doing fucking nothing.
9. Down Cost Average into Stocks, Crypto, Bonds, etc.

Side hustles, and side gigs provided by companies are effectively robbing you for your time. Don't buckle the knee for a quick buck unless it means life or death.

## Raises & Income

There are some things you need to know about raises in the modern day working culture. There's two ways to go about it.

1. Join a union, and work your way up the ladder, but make sure the union and pay will let you achieve a livable wage. Otherwise move on to something else.
2. Get your first entry level job, and stay for a little while.
	1. After staying for 'x' amount of time and put together a lot of impressive things you can probably look for the next job. Stay for a minimum of 2, but don't stay longer than 5 unless you really like your job.
	2. You should be getting a raise every single year to keep up with inflation, if the job is incapable of doing this, then you're effectively getting a pay cut.

## Spirituality

Even if you don’t believe in a higher power, it’s still good to connect with yourself spiritually. Our brains are complex and we’re only seeing a few planes of existence with our eyes. We can see physically, we can hear, we can smell, we can taste, and we can feel. However, we cannot ‘see’ the other planes of existence that may or may not exist in our world.

Respect everything that you see, or touch because who knows what else may exist out there.

Find something that makes sense to you and stick to it.

## Direction Over Speed

When you're first starting your life it's important to be climbing the right mountain. If you're climbing the wrong mountain you'll need to descend and start over from scratch. It's much better to climb a mountain slowly and carefully to ensure that you're on the right path. 

The definition of success will be determined not by how fast you climb a mountain but how little effort was needed to climb that mountain.

My mountain was programming.

## Happiness is Relative

We all have a baked in limitation on how happy we can be. We have a relative amount of happiness which is either incredibly high, or very low. We can artificially increase our happiness through the use of substances but it does not mean it's good for you.

Your level of happiness will never match up to others levels of happiness and that's okay. We're all living relative happiness and we can only be so happy with ourselves and our lives.

## It's All Bullshit

Life and its entire meaning is complete bullshit and we only derive meaning by doing things that we want to do. Only you can determine what life's meaning is and it requires a lot of solo contemplation and inner thoughts over several years.

Take some time to be alone and think about who you are as a person and find out what you really enjoy and like. Nobody can tell you what it will be and nobody can make that decision for you.

## Life's Purpose

You need to have a purpose in life to have a fulfilling life. That's pretty much it.

Here are some archetypes that will help you derive life's purpose.

1. The Jester
	1. Become the entertainment and entertainment provider for people in life so that they can relax more. This will inheritably bring a lot of purpose to your life.
2. The Care Giver
	1. Help others in their time of need by making their life easier. Care for them, and treat their needs in the form of hospitality.
3. The Builder
	1. Build things that people want to use, and provide things that will help people achieve their individual goals.
4. The Listener
	1. Provide a safe space for people to come to you and just dump their trauma all over you. Bonus points if you never gossip about it and you can hold secrets incredibly well.
5. The Leader
	1. Become the voice of your people and lead them through dark times and dire situations. Leaders are incredibly hard to come by and by putting yourself out in the world you can become targeted by people who are envious of you.

## Go to College Last

I'm of the proponent that College is a bad choice until you're ready to climb that mountain. You don't want to go to College until you're certain that the profession that you want is the one that requires College education.

Education is not a bad thing but almost everything can be learned through hard work and a whole lot of reading paired with trial and error. Ensure you're on the right foot out of the gate by working terrible jobs and ensuring you have a relative point to build your success off of. 

Everyone should work bad jobs because then you can truly see how fucking terrible the average human being can be.

A lot of people wind up going to College and then realizing that it's not what they wanted to do.

Additionally, College can be cheap if you go to a community college and stop going out-of-state because it's the cool thing to do.

If you don't minimize your debt through College you'll start off the wrong foot and it'll be hard to catch up.

## Find Your Hard Reset Button

Everyone has one of these but they're incredibly difficult to discover for most people. The hard reset button is effectively what you can do to make you perform at the highest level. 

For myself it's pretty much coding very late at night without anyone around followed by a really long period of uninterrupted sleep. This ensures that I enter a zen-like state that really turns me around after a day or two.

Some people need their social battery refilled so they have to have full human contact with deep conversations to really feel good about themselves again.

We all need different things; but we all also have a hard reset button.

## Wealth is a Hidden Power Level

There are many people in the world that like flaunting their wealth by simply buying fancy vehicles, clothing, and items. The true wealthy individuals do not flaunt their wealth and try to live in a way that does not show their wealth.

If you want to be wealthy then you must first start with the currency you are being given and hoarding that currency in as many ways possible. You also must go against societal pressure to look like you have more.

Wealth is an exponential curve that when you put more money in, you get more money out and that compounding money builds upon itself to build more wealth.

## Social Media is Toxic

Social media is inheritely toxic as fuck these days. You should avoid the brain rot as much as possible.

Avoid TikTok, Avoid YouTube Shorts, Avoid Instagram Reels.

None of these apps are introducing actual value into your life other than mindlessly scrolling and listening to what other humans are spitting out.

You'll have a much simpler life keeping these things off of your phone.

If you have to have social media, ensure that it's only used for your work and productivity.

Frankly, I use BlueSky at this current point in time to help build my follower base.

## Celebrate Talent

When you see others who are struggling but are inheritely talented at what they do, try to lift them up in whatever way you can.

Giving them a platform and letting others know about them is the smallest gesture you can do.

## Privacy is Default

Everyone should have the right to privacy for their individual data. I think it's very important that users own their own data, and are responsible for their own data.

What users choose to publish and 'give' to other platforms is just relinquishing rights to your data.

Fundamentally I think we need to handle data in a very different way, where the individual user is the sole provider of the data.
