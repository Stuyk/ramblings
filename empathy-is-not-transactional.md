# Empathy is Not Transactional

I am tired of this shit

You tell all of these people to get some grit

Yet the king you worship says to feed the hungry

To say it bluntly half the country can't be fucked to feed them humbly

Almost like we're a balkan fucking country, corrupt to the core

They want to keep us poor and fight their stupid wars

Pure abhor they say as they continue to blame anyone but the hoard

Holding all the wealth and not paying their share

We should all care because the trickle down is just piss from the core

Fuck the 1%, a collective group of transactional blood sucking pedos

They scream they're cost-effective but all I see is something defective

They're deflective

A collective of ineffective leaders

These sneakers are gonna stomp someday

A cliche you may say, but when we're hungry we'll have a fucking buffet
