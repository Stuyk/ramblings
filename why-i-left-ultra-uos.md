# Why I left Ultra ($UOS)

Ultra did a lot of really awesome things for my career and I had a lot to learn.

In a weird chain of events I ended up being part of the first 15~ or so employees who were working on Ultra's Decentralized Gaming Platform that distributed games.

Over 5 years it's hard to fully understand the amount of work that I put into all sorts of problems they were dealing with.

## Timeline

This may be a bit fuzzy because I was there for 5 years. Wires get crossed.

1. I was hired, I was naive, and I was feeling awesome.
2. Tech lead and I began working on the NFT system for distributed video games.
3. We hit a wall, and eventually overcame a larger issue with the initial NFT solution.
4. I began writing the initial test version of the NFT solution in C++
5. The test solution was completed and it proved that there was more to do.
6. I took my hands off the project and pivoted to our wallet software.
7. The first version of the wallet was a desktop app that worked with WebSockets.
8. It did everything it needed to do.
9. However, one thing that irks me to this day is that another team came in and smashed Angular into it.
10. I no longer had my wallet and it became a shallow product of its former self.
11. Moving on, I took my hands off this project.
12. We needed a solution to onboard users without adding the complexity of private keys.
13. We came up with a solution that effectively stored half the key on the user side, and the other on Ultra's side.

> This should be alarming for anyone who is a security maximalist.

14. With the EOS account systems we also setup the permission system to allow for overriding active keys through Ultra's centralized infrastructure

> What I mean by this is that there are systems in place to overwrite your active key when you 'forget your password'.
> The keys are not currently yours and by design the chain's active keys can always be overwritten by a larger permission system.
> While this is good for the consumer, it's not good for security breaches. Unironically your coins are probably safer on Ethereum.

15. After integrating this system we pretty much launched the chain. One guy specifically did it really well and has since moved on from Ultra. He's still awesome.
16. We hired lots of new engineers for the blockchain team, and even some that I looked up to and learned from before joining Ultra.
17. Ultra suddenly decides that NFTs are high priority and we need to tokenize images, trying to cash in on non-video game things.
18. We begin creating a larger NFT system that handles all types of aspects from game items to game keys themselves.

> Reminder that games stored as NFTs are not stored as NFTs. Only the license is. You still have to download the game from somewhere.

19. I notice that our desktop client is some weird chrome fork, you may remember this.

> A single person was working on this weird chrome fork and nobody else knew anything about it.
> We never hired anyone to try and work on it with this one person. The entire company was teetering on this one guy.

20. Eventually Ultra finally sees that we need to switch to Electron or something more maintainable. I believe Axel was the one responsible for bringing this up.
21. NFTs are now a bad word and the general consumer market is not okay with NFTs.
22. Someone at the top or whoever had the bright idea to rename NFTs to UNIQS. Which... come on dawg... lol
23. Keywords and phrasing starts getting mixed up in the company as we try and rebrand NFTs for general consumers.
24. Wider gaming market absolutely hates NFTs besides the Web 3.0 industry.
25. The original target to try and capture around 5-10% of the gaming market is now dead in the water because NFTs are a bad word.
26. I started focusing on tools to help developers build on our platform.
27. I kept seeing nothing happening from the community so I built smart contract tools, vscode extensions, etc.
28. I pushed to improve our docs as much as possible and lead the effort to try and get developers onboarded.
29. I asked if we could even integrate our desktop client into games, nope. No SDK yet.
30. We apparently also purchased a screen overlay company for games. This already exists for Electron, we wasted a lot of money on this.
31. I'm sitting here wondering what the fuck we're doing at this point.
32. First round of layoffs start happening, immediately made myself available elsewhere.
33. Second round of layoffs happened.
34. Left Ultra to go work with a different company and a different tech stack entirely, and I'm 99% Ultra will fail at this point.
35. Left my concerns with our tech lead and everyone else.
36. There was another round of layoffs not too long ago that got rid of some highly regarded people in the company.

## Reflecting 

I've stated this dozens of times over and over again across the board.

NFTs are not wanted by the general gaming community and changing that perspective is going to be an impossible task.

Only larger publishers are going to be able to make this happen and when it does it will be forced down the consumer's throats.

Steam is an excellent platform and convenience is king, nobody cares about the technology behind the platform even if it allows them to resell a game.

Ultra was a significant stepping stone in my growth as a professional but also pushing me to question authorative figures much more as what they say will not ease the overall market.

## What Ultra should have Done

1. Company should have fully focused on developers first.
2. Company should have moved to Electron earlier.
3. Company should have not bought the screen overlay software.
5. Company should have moved off of Angular entirely.
6. Company should have allowed for users to export their private keys sooner? Did they do this yet?
7. Be very transparent

## What I should have Done

1. Brought up concerns about the Chromium client earlier
2. Pushed back against the Angular integration for the wallet
3. Brought up my opinions about the concerns with consumers and NFTs earlier
4. Pushed to champion the developer SDK for video games

## What I'm Doing Today

Well, obviously I'm not in this company anymore but I'm challenging myself much more than I did before.

Growth is something that just happens as you get more experience.

1. I'm advocating for myself and the tools that I write.
2. I'm advocating and calling out bad decisions as they arise.
3. I'm pushing for user experience and communication over anything else.
4. I'm pushing for transparency at every single angle.
5. I'm building software that I care about but also preparing for the future. ie. Quantum, and AI attacks.

## In Summary

Ultra is an interesting company that tried to do lots of interesting things that were challenging the overall game market. However, the consumers have pushed back and are no longer interested in Web 3 products. 

They have lots of interesting tech behind the scenes and unfortunately I don't think there's much of a vision left as they've lost their way after 5 years of building.

I've learned a lot about what makes a company successful given the circumstances above and it all comes down to integration and hyper focused results.

Ultra should have been the Game Distributor for Web 3 enthusiasts first. Anything else after that was a bonus.

Thanks for reading and hope you find this insightful.
