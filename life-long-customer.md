Congratulations, you have now become a lifelong customer from the expense of a time before you were even born. If you're a United States citizen you're totally fucked but not completely fucked just yet. 

## Section 0. Customer Lifetime Value

Companies look at citizens like a flock of cash, and they look at you for your CLV, or Customer Lifetime Value. Which means that a customer who is addicted to a product, or has a high dependence on a product results in a long Customer Lifetime Value. 

These flocks of cash will continue to produce cash as long as they continue to be addicted to the product. Originally, the ultimate Customer Lifetime Value were users of Nicotine products and cigarettes. However, there was a strong push before the Reagan administration to start banning Tobacco products during the 1970s.

Tobacco industries seeing the writing on the wall decided to divest their wealth into other industries by shuttling themselves inside of free-market economics during the Reagan Administration.

## Section 1. Free Market Economics

Reagan's administration reduced federal oversight across various industries, including transportation, telecommunications, and finance, which encouraged mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructuring.

Deregulation made it easier for companies like tobacco and pharmaceutical corporations to diversify into food distribution through acquisitions, as regulatory barriers were loosened.

This allowed these companies to thrive financially and use their profits to diversify into other industries, such as food distribution.

The lack of aggressive tobacco regulation during this period gave companies like Philip Morris the financial strength to pursue acquisitions like **Kraft** (Now Kraft & Heinz Co.) and **Nabisco** (Now Mondelez International, Inc.).

They were given a free pass to move out of the Tobacco Industry, and directly into the food that people are eating.

## Section 2. Cheap Food at a Cost

As we industrialized and processed foods they became cheaper to create. Creating a bunch of food that was hyper-palatable as well as encouraging high consumption of the food themselves.

What we've now come into is a set of incredibly processed foods that makes it not only easy to obtain, but also obtain large amounts of food.

By introducing various unregulated chemicals and byproducts into these foods it has made several generations highly addicted to these foods.  This is not only done through chemicals but also through portion control, packaging, emotional and sensory appeals, as well as advertisements and promotions.

The pharmaceutical and tabaco industries in the United states have created the ultimate Customer Lifetime Value by getting everyone addicted to ultra processed foods. Creating a pandemic of highly obese citizens with incredibly poor health.

Additional fun fact: The United States is one of the only few Countries that allows for pharmaceutical companies to advertise on national television.

## Section 3. Poison the Herd, Sell the Solution

Now that these companies have made you a high value customer by degrading your health to the point in which you are barely surviving they start selling you solutions to the problems by turning you to the highly profitable pharmaceutical industry.

Do you have high blood pressure? Well boy does the pharmaceutical industry have a slight solution for you but not a cure!

Do you have too much sugar in your bloodstream? Well boy does the pharmaceutical industry have a slight solution for you but not a cure!

Do you have a failing organ? Well we can slow down the failure but never sell you the cure.

Do you want to know what the cure is? It's eating whole foods and dropping the processed  garbage we're all eating.

The entire United States is now deeply in the pockets of the Tabaco and Pharmaceutical industry and we are dealing with a nationwide epidemic of people who are highly addicted to ultra processed foods.

Once they feed you all the shit that's giving you cancer and making your life terrible they turn you over to the pharmaceutical industry to help make you feel better. 

They just don't tell you to get off the garbage.

## Section 4. Writing on the Wall

As with all history it does seem to repeat itself we are now seeing various upticks and pushback from people who are starting to catch on to the schemes and lies we're all being shown. These same industries are looking for a new way to get us addicted to new products.

Let's talk about some of the new kids on the block.

1. Vaping
	1. We have no idea what is in these products and what the chemicals in these products will do to you in the long-term. You have been warned.
2. Highly concentrated THC products
	1. I'm a firm believer that THC is fine if it's mixed with the right amount of CBD but a lot of companies are just selling you the high to fuck up your mental health.
3. Nicotine Strips
	1. It's fucking Nicotine, the most addicting compound. Good luck quitting this shit.
4. Weight Loss Compounds (GLP-1, and so on and so forth)
	1. These can actually be good if you can kick the shit that got you fat in the first place.
	2. Isn't that hilarious? They get you completely unhealthy, sell you a partial cure, but never tell you to fix what you eat.
5. Expensive Land
	1. As companies continue to divest into land it will soon be impossible to own land to grow your own food. 
	2. The world economic forum is partially responsible for this. Don't even get me started on these fuckers.

## Section 5. What do you do?

Here's a general list of things you can do to protect yourself from all of this.

1. Grow Food
	1. No land? Use hydroponics.
		1. Your only excuse is your lack of knowledge.
		2. At least until they buy up the entire water supply like that Rich asshole in California did, but fuck that shit just do some rain water capture. Fuck these rich pricks.
2. Quit Vaping
3. Use Marijuana Products Responsibly
	1. No Concentrated Shit
4. Avoid Nicotine at all costs
5. Wait for the Biohackers to come up with homegrown solutions.
	1. We've got an entire group of people becoming their own guinea pigs to try and solve their own problems. Give them sometime and pay close attention to what Fecal Transplant people are doing for Gut Health.
