# Protecting Your Digital Footprint

Are you really seeing everything online, or are you experiencing the internet through a filtered window?

Depending on who you are as a person, it's important to only expose certain aspects of your life to the wider internet.

Why? Well, the information you provide to these services is used in the economies that they are building.

Any individual bit of data that they get on you as a person makes it easier for [algorithms to manipulate you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right_pipeline).

After all, we are very [selective on what we are able to perceive and only do as we are told](https://osheenjain.medium.com/science-of-selective-attention-how-we-filter-information-and-why-it-matters-644582c9e844).

## Social Media

Social media companies are directly pushing agenda that is meant to control you as a citizen but also your individual thought patterns. Algorithms [control what you see, and expose you to information to change your opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1d14916/apparently_different_comments_show_up_on_videos/).

If you are heavily tapped into any social media you are being radicalized in one way or another.

Don't even get me started on traditional media including [Fox, MSNBC, ABC, etc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo) they're all pushing the same narratives.

We as a species are not [capable of filtering out AI generated slop](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/14/1251072726/ai-spam-images-facebook-linkedin-threads-meta), there's even a large amount of people that can't even tell AI generated content from normal content. We've reached a cliff, and if you're still on these platforms you've already jumped off of that cliff.

**Get off of all social media, and never look back.**

## Dumbify your Phone

The idea behind this is that you make your phone so boring and mundane that it no longer is catching your attention.

You can do this by modifying your phone to use specific 'dumbifying' applications, switching to a flip phone, or [buying a dumb phone outright](https://www.thelightphone.com/lightiii?ref=mgywzdc&tm_page=best-dumbphones).

Here's a few ways you can do this now, if you're an iPhone user:

- Turn on Grayscale
- [Get Dumbify](https://dumbifyapp.com/), it's a bit tricky to setup so maybe watch a tutorial on it
- Remove everything but Phone, Messaging, Maps, and maybe Banking from your Home Screen
- Turn it on Sleep Mode, Forever. No notifications, ever.

That's really it, you want to eliminate all of the applications that are catching your attention.

This also removes your digital footprint for 99% of the stuff that you're doing.

## Separate Your Business

If you're someone who uses social media for business related functionalities then I highly suggest that you get a business specific laptop.

The only thing that you do on that laptop is business related tasks. You have your business accounts, your business applications, and business related things.

This ensures that you keep your business separate from your actual life, and protect your life as much as possible.

You don't need a super expensive laptop to do business, and if you're bitching because it's too slow then that's because your dopamine receptors are fucking fried.

## Use Privacy Focused Browsers

When you're using applications for the internet, even on your phone you should be using privacy focused browsers.

1. [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), bonus for this one because it natively blocks ads and trackers.
2. [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/focus/)
3. [DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser](https://duckduckgo.com)

By using the individual browsers instead of the native applications on your phone or desktop this prevents those apps from getting native access to your phone, computer, etc.

These browsers play an important role in protecting your digital footprint.

## Encryption

You may not remember this, but there was a time when iCloud was hacked and a whole lot of photos were leaked online.

This was because people were not encrypting their data. Encrypting data means there's a layer of security in front of it that prevents certain individuals from accessing your data.

**Did you know that iCloud Encryption is not turned on by default?**

Anyway, take a look at this [article to learn more](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651).

Encryption is not for everyone but you should practice it to further protect yourself, your loved ones, and whatever conversations you may be having.

### Messaging

Don't trust these mega corporations to encrypt your data and promise that it's encrypted. Instead, use services that actually just encrypt your data.

[Signal](https://signal.org/) is an Open Source fully encrypted messenger, it actually does exactly what it should. 

Unfortunately there are are [a lot of stupid people using it too](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/25/nx-s1-5339753/signal-war-plan-breach-security-experts).

### Storage

If you need a general purpose solution for storing your data in the cloud, consider Cryptomator.

It allows you to sync to other places like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. but it fully encrypts your data.

[Here's a link to Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)

## Your Password System Sucks

If you're like 99% of the people on this planet your password is probably some equivalent of your favorite pet, a birth year, and some food.

This is incredibly dumb because every year we move forward, more and more password hashes are being revealed making it easier to get your accounts hijacked.

Which is why you should use a password manager, and learn how to use it.

There are a few different tiers to go through but lemme explain.

### Basic User

You should probably use [1Password](https://1password.com/), only because it's incredibly simple.

You can generate complex passwords for all of your accounts and secure everything you need to secure.

### Moderate User

You should probably use [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/) as it is vetted and used by security experts.

### Advanced User

You should probably run your own with [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) and store it yourself through cloud storage systems.

## 2 Factor Authentication Sucks

I've been hacked before, and it wasn't a simple hack. It was a very complex hack where a team was able to contact my Phone Carrier, activate a new sim card, and then proceed to use 2 Factor Authentication to quickly hijack all of my accounts.

I've since recovered from this, but I've stepped up my security game quite a bit over the years.

Which is why I'm saying that 2 Factor Authentication is trash, and you should never link your phone number to your account where possible.

Instead get a physical key like a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/) which will let you secure your accounts.

If you don't want to buy a physical key, at the very least get a [2 Factor Authentication App](http://2fas.com/)

## Your Email Sucks

If you're using gmail, hotmail, outlook, etc. you are vastly underestimating what these other email service providers can do for you.

Check out these email providers: [Tuta](https://tuta.com/) & [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)

## Your Internet Sucks

Every website you visit can be more or less tracked. VPNs help by re-routing your traffic to other data centers.

Here's 2 of them that are generally trusted and do not keep logs.
