# Financial Freedom is Simple

The majority of us aren’t just daydreaming about being millionaires; we’re actively showing off lifestyles that exceed our actual financial means. And while many aspire to a comfortable retirement, lifestyle inflation often prevents them from saving adequately for the future.

This guide is going to be so brain dead simple anyone can follow it.

## 0. Build a Budget

There are all these amazing ways to build a budget but the basics can be done with a google sheet.

No amount of fancy budgeting tools is gonna make you as a person accountable for where your funds go.

You have to have discipline, and you have to have some diamond hands to make sure money is going to all of the right places.

If you haven't built a budget, make sure you fucking do it.

Don't read this part and ignore, BUILD A FUCKING BUDGET.

GO INTO YOUR STATEMENTS, AND LOOK AT ALL THAT MONEY YOU SPENT.

LOOK AT ALL YOUR LOANS, GET YOUR APYs, GET YOUR PRINCIPAL VALUES LEFT.

Statistics don't care about how you feel, you know what you spent and you need to stop it.

In the wise words of Caleb Hammer

- 50% on Needs, income for housing food, utilities, transport, healthcare.
- 30% on Wants, income for entertainment, dining, hobbies.
- 20% on Savings, income that never gets spent and goes straight into a high-yield savings.

In the wise words of Stuyk

- 50% on Needs
- 10% on Wants, you buy things over a long period of time. Not all at once.
- 40% on Savings

## 1. Stop Being a Consumer

In order to make it to retirement the game has changed, but it's still the same game. You need to stop eating out, stop doing door dash, stop buying expensive clothes, stop buying all of the unncessary shit that you don't need.

1. Eat less food, have less snacks for yourself
   - If you have more snacks for your kids and self-control they're not gonna remember not being poor.
   - A lot of us can survive off of a single meal a day, but **it requires discipline**.
  
2. Buy clothes from thrift stores, or don't buy it at all
  
3. Buy furniture from thrift stores, or don't buy it at all
  
4. Buy from cheaper grocery stores, not not the dollar tree; King Soopers, Aldi, etc.
   - The reason why the dollar tree sucks is that they prey on the poorest of the bunch. They sell you less for more. They're predatory assholes.
  
5. Give Up Meat
   - In the US we're taught to eat meat. Instead buy black beans, tofu, eggs, lentils, greek yogurt (plain), etc.
   - If you choose not to give up meat, Costco has the best bang-for-your-buck chicken breast.
  
6. Don't Have Kids Early
   - This is one of those things that if you did the deed, it's too late. Sorry friend.
   - In any case, if you're early keep in mind that **raising a kid until 18 is about $375,000 per child in the US in 2025**.
   - _The average age Germans have their kids is around 30 years old._
    
7. Sugary Snacks, NOPE
   - Processed foods, sodas, and all that garbage is eating your budget like its nobodies business.
   - You know what's free? Water. Drink some fucking water.
   - Want to make it flavorful? Just get some concentrate lemon juice, and spice it up every once in a while.
    
8. Stop Going Out for Coffee
   - I'm not even joking, the average person can spend upwards of $10.00 for a sugary ass coffee.
   - How about you grow the fuck up and drink it black, it's cheaper. Discipline never tasted so bitter.
    
9. Gadgets
   - Get the cheapest phone you can, and never look back. Dumbify it too, it's trendy.
   - There's only one gadget you may need, and that's a laptop to build your spreadsheet.
   - Otherwise, if you're not in tech and you're working in real life then you probably don't need it.

Have you seen the price of fast food lately? Holy shit it's so god damn expensive that you can feed yourself for an entire week with what is spent there.

You should be going to thrift stores and any store that will let you buy the necessities without buying `new`.

Habitat for Humanity, Goodwill, arc, to name just a few of them.

Fun fact, if you drive to the more expensive neighborhoods you can often find brand new stuff because a lot of these rich people are also living paycheck to paycheck and buy new stuff all the time.

## 2. Do you have debt?

There are two types of debt and they are both uniquely different.

1. High-Interest Debt - Greater than 4%
2. Low-Interest Debt - Less than 4%

High interest debt absolutely must be paid off first, and more often than not high-interest debt is tied to credit cards because banks are huge jerks who are trying to make a profit off of you.

Why does it matter, well if you want a simple explanation. If a high-yield savings account can beat the low-interest debt then it's better to save that money that it is to pay it off sooner.

Basically, you beat the markets if the interest is low enough.

## 3. Pay off Credit Cards

The first step to financial freedom is to pay off your high-interest credit cards. Not only should **not be making minimum payments** on a credit card, you should be **throwing as much money as possible into those credit cards**. You should be trying to get those credit cards closed as soon as possible.

Why you might ask? Well because you didn't properly use the credit card in the way it was meant to be used, meaning that you accured debt on it at an incredibly high interest, you were gamed by the system. You lose! You can't responsibly hold a credit card and you should close it as soon as possible.

Every dollar that goes to a banks interest is a dollar you lost investing into your future.

Stop complaining, and pay them off.

## 4. Pay off Loans

Do you have a loan with a high interest above 4.5%? Then you need to pay that off. I don't care how you do it, every single paycheck **you should be paying the minimum, and putting the excess towards principal**.

What this means is that when you pay down the principal the total loan balances goes down.

Pay it off.

## 5. Endurance is Key

Want to know what all these other millionaires did to ensure that they're wealthy. They endured being poor for so long that they slowly put away all of their money in the right places.

There are currently 3 ways to retire in the United States and even then you shouldn't retire because you're wasting your golden years filled with wisdom and experience.

1. Luck, yup it's just pure fucking luck.
2. Boglehead Investing, you simply invest into the stock market in funds like the S&P 500, VOO, VTI, VSUX, etc.
3. FIRE Retirement Planning (Diversify with Crypto, Stocks, Mutual Funds, etc.)
   - The pathway is basically (Pay Credit Cards Off -> Pay Loans Off -> Pay Auto Loans Off -> Build 6 Months Cost of Living Emergency Fund -> Invest in 401k (If Available) -> Open and Max Out an IRA Every Year -> Invest Leftovers in Stock Market)

What 2 and 3 have in common is that when they're making investments no matter if the market is up or down, they continue to buy stocks regardless of the market. It's called dollar cost average investing.

These people simply don't care about what the market does, they just know that given a 100 year track record, the stocks will always go up.
