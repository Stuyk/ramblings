# Why Dither was Built

In the digital age, the promise of free expression often clashes with the reality of centralized content moderation and censorship. A new piece of software, Dither, offers a powerful solution by leveraging the fundamental architecture of blockchain technology to create a truly permanent and uncensorable public forum.

## The Simple, Yet Revolutionary, Mechanism

Dither's brilliance lies in its simplicity and adaptability. It's not a new blockchain; it's a software layer designed to operate on any existing blockchain that supports a transaction memo field.

When a user posts a message via Dither, that text is embedded within a standard blockchain transaction's memo field. This process is crucial because:

Permanence: Transactions are bundled into blocks, and these blocks are stored perpetually across the entire decentralized network. The memo, and therefore the message, is saved forever.

Accessibility: All blockchain data is inherently public. Anyone can read, write, or even build their own client software to access the data posted via Dither.

In essence, Dither transforms the blockchain's memo field, a minor technical component, into a global, indelible, and open-source public bulletin board.

## Why Dither is an Essential "Freedom-Fighting Tool"

The core value proposition of Dither is its defense against censorship. The data it posts cannot be removed by a central authority, making it an invaluable tool for journalists, activists, and anyone needing to share information without fear of reprisal.

### The Near-Impossibility of Deletion

To effectively censor a piece of information posted on Dither, one would have to do the near-impossible:

- Shut down all validators that secure the chosen blockchain network.

- Delete all stored data from every single validator, node, and backup server across the globe.

Given that many of these blockchains are secured by hundreds of continuously replicating and backing up nodes, any attempt to erase data is futile. The information remains replicated, distributed, and publicly available, making Dither a truly censorship-resistant publishing tool.

## User Sovereignty and Data Integrity

Dither is designed to eliminate the middleman entirely, not just in publishing but also in consumption. The platform’s greatest power is the control it hands back to the user over what they see.

### You Are Your Own Algorithm

Unlike centralized platforms that push information based on opaque, proprietary algorithms, Dither allows anyone to write the algorithms that determine what data they consume. This means you can completely customize:

- Who you follow.

- What content is pushed to you.

- How that information is filtered and displayed.

The user becomes the supreme editor of their feed, giving them ultimate sovereignty over their information consumption.

### The Immutable Record
Even if a third-party API or client application for Dither were to delete or filter content, the original message always remains available on the blockchain. This separation is crucial: the blockchain is the single, unalterable source of truth.

Any post can be confirmed, verified, looked at, and downloaded directly from the chain by anyone, at any time. The public nature of the blockchain ensures that the original, immutable data is always forever visible, making it the ultimate tool for verification and transparency.

## Accountability Turned Up to 11

Dither isn't just a platform for speaking freely; it's a forum that fosters absolute accountability.

When you post on Dither, you are not just putting information "on the internet"—you are cementing it into a global, distributed ledger that cannot be altered. This creates an environment where users must consider their words carefully, as their posts are permanently associated with their actions on the blockchain.

Dither serves as a powerful new tool for open discussion and holding narratives to an unyielding standard of permanence. It offers a way to bluntly and effectively share a truth, an ideology, or engage in a discussion, knowing that the record will stand forever.
