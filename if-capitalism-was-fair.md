# If Capitalism Was Fair

In a society that is run by capitalism is preys on people purchasing your individual product regardless of whether or not it actually helps you. Capitalism likes to lie and cheat people out of their money and eliminate competition by acquiring other businesses and creating monopolies.

If Capitalism were actually fair it would probably look something like this:

- Billionaires would simply not exist

- Monetary caps for all people and businesses would exist

- Monetary overflow from caps would uplift society

- Healthcare would be free due to monetary caps

- Childcare would be free due to monetary caps

- Mandatory school integration for all children to receive the same education

- There are simply no better schools, but the same schools uplifted by wealth overflow

- No single business would be allowed to diversify into more businesses

- No single business may be allowed to acquire other businesses

- All businesses specialize into their niche, creating paternship between all businesses

- Foreign countries would determine whom can do business in their country

- People would not be able to borrow against their assets

- Death taxes would be a thing to resettle the playing field for the next generation

- You must reside in the State or Country of residence to own land

- Corporations would not be allowed to purchase housing

- Corporations would not pollute the water shared by the people

I'm sure there are many holes in my logic and that's fine but we can all agree that if you're paying $400/m for health insurance for yourself and you still have to pay for it then the system is broken.

Inflation is a way to prevent the uneducated from getting their footing in our overly complicated economic system that was designed to keep people poor.

Teachers are taking the brunt of childcare and they're completely underpaid for it.
