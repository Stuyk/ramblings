# Generation Breakdown

I am a millenial and I'm not afraid to admit that. I also have strong overlap with the elder GenZ since I'm just around the cut off period. I understand the struggles of GenZ but I also am watching from a distance as all of my friends, peers, and chosen family struggle to move through their lives. There isn't a single break in time that allows them to catch a break, or effectively catch up to the game that they were forced into playing.

This is a small post about where I think I was failed as a child and where my education failed me.

## Upbringing

I came from a middle class family and we had a lot of toys and gadgets. I was effectively an advantaged child as I was given a lot of things that helped me explore my hobbies with ease. 

However, this came at the cost of my family not being interested in anything that I was interested in. Being interested in computers, it made it even more difficult for my family to actually understand what I was doing and why I was so passionate about it. 

My mom was great with computers but there came a time when I was ripping them apart and rebuilding them and she was not.

Which, in the end this resulted in a gap in my family where as I grew up on the internet it became easy to navigate the space and understand where `things felt off`. Which is a nice way of saying there's a lot of fucked up places, ideas, and people on the internet.

## Graduating Childhood

As I left childhood and began working I got a firm understanding of society by simply being in the workforce. None of my family taught me anything about bills, money, financials, balancing budgets, navigating jobs, applying to jobs, paying bills, getting an apartment, etc.

Basically, the world changed so much between my childhood and when I entered the workforce it completely upended all parenting abilities. What I mean by this is that if your parents were like my parents; they had pensions, retirement plans, healthcare, and could afford things. 

Let me further elaborate what I'm trying to say here:

### Retirement Plans

They removed the pensions which would pay out forever, and put it on the employee. We now have 401ks and IRAs we must contribute to in order to retire.

## Social Security

At no point did anyone mention that the social security we pay into pays for the generation that is the oldest. 

All of our money is deducted into a failed social safety net that the 'responsible citizens' of the US voted to dismantle.

By dismantle I mean putting people in power that would make the social security fund insolvent by late 2032.

### Poor Tax

At no point did anyone mention that poorer you are the more money you have to make to exit. I mean that if you live in an impoverished area that has crime, and a massive wealth gap. You're going to pay more.

- You must pay more for car insurance.
- You must pay more for property damage.
- You must pay more for your groceries, the dollar tree is more expensive. Look it up.
- You must pay more for medical problems because they're too expensive to fix.

Point being, if you are poor. You are suffering. You are valid, this system is evil.

### Be Anything!

We were told that we could be anything in society, as long as we worked hard enough. Which was true for the TRADES and not COLLEGE.

College is a special beast because you walk away with over $80,000 of student debt. 

We had very poor financial knowledge that the 'responsible citizens' avoided teaching us for their benefit.

After all... grifters don't like smart people.

### Financial Literacy

If you are like me, your parents probably taught you nothing about economics. 

- I had no idea what a 401k was. 
- I had no idea what an IRA was.
- I had no idea how compounding interest worked.
- I had no idea how interest rates worked. 
- I had no understanding of all the financial ins and outs of society.
- I had no idea what stock was.
- I had no idea what "a lot of money" was considered

Which sets you up for failure when you're told you have to take out an $80,000 loan to enrich the banks; you know, for funsies.

### Interesting Times

- We understand nothing about mental health, let's stop understanding and dissolve all practice
- Starting a war with Iraq, we must be living in interesting times.
- Everyone has a phone, we must be living in interesting times.
- Everyone is incapable of peer reviewing news, we must be living in interesting times.
- Everyone is falling behind on their mortgages and it's causing a recession, we must be living in interesting times.
- Everyone is losing their jobs, we must be living in interesting times.
- Everyone at school is being shot at, we must be living in interesting times.
- Multiple bomb go off on US soil, we must be living in interesting times.
- A global pandemic shuts everything down, we must be living in interesting.

Look, what ended up happening is that any time a Millenial or GenZ entered the workforce in its current state there were massive global implications for the United States. It seemingly spiraled out of control.

We're tired of living in interesting times because we can't catch a fucking break.

### Housing Disadvantage

With the wealth inequality being so out-of-control our generation gets to live through insane hyper inflation and a housing crisis. 

Not only are apartments and houses being gobbled up by venture capitalists and financial firms. Even outside investors are buying in your society where they don't even reside.

This is the **average cost of a 1 bedroom apartment** in the US.

- Rent in 2001 -> $662
- Rent in 2008 -> $845
- Rent in 2020 -> $1185
- Rent in 2025 -> $1650

It's incredibly expensive for housing in the US. Which means a majority of paycheck goes to housing.

Especially considering the average **median** salary is roughly around $39,000.

This is a nearly unlivable salary but you can definitely make it if you can manage to get a full-time salary position at a company. LOL

Anyway, the actual average salary of a US worker working under minimum wage is $19,800.

Yet you wonder why people are complaining about the economy, and anyone with a brain can look at that and say that's fucking insane.

BECAUSE IT IS. YOU ARE VALID. EVERYTHING IS INSANE.

## The Outcome

I will start by stating that I am an anomally in this system, I lucked out by basically doing very few interviews for everything position I've gotten into.

I am lucky, and I continue to be lucky.

However, for the majority of people it probably looks like this:

- $50,000 of Student Loan Debt
  - $270 for a 6.5% Rate on $50,000 of Debt
- Renting a $1800 Apartment
- Spending $400-600 on Groceries
- Paying $100-150 for Electric
- Paying $80-100 for Heat
- Paying $100 for Internet

Seems affordable only until you add up and realize that $2,750 is $33,000 a year which... MOST PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD.

If you can afford it you might be lucky to save $1,000 a year under those circumstances.
