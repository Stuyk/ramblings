# The Internet is Forever

I feel like it's an ample time to remember that what you say and do on the internet will forever be remembered. 

There is no removing it. 

There is no deleting it.

There is only manipulating it and casting shallow veils over the things you do.

What you say to people.

What you do to people.

It all comes to light eventually, and the inevitable fallout is always emaculate.
