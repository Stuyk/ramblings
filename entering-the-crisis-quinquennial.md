# The Crisis Quinquennial

There is a book that is called the Fourth Turning which was written by Neil Howe and William Strauss. To summarize what is in this book is that America works in a series of patterns that like to have a tussle with the universe from time to time.

Each pattern can effectively be split into 4 different time blocks.

1. High
	1. Strengthened institutions and weakened individualism
2. Awakening
	1. A passionate era of spiritual upheaval.
3. Unraveling
	1. Begin weakening and attacking the institutions.
	2. Promote individualism.
	3. You are in charge! You are your own boss!
4. Crisis <-- We Are Here
	1. Begin upheaving the entire system to try and replace it
	2. Begin pivoting people against each other
	3. Can be violent, and sometimes can be peaceful
	4. Empires change power here.

We are currently entering the `crisis` phase of the time block. This time block can best be described as a global upheaval of an entire civic order and whether or not that is violent is entirely dependent on how civilians feel and how brainwashed they have become.

## Evidence

There are two realities which currently exist in the United States and some see through one reality and some see through another reality. Regardless of the actual facts that are presented to some of these people they look for any piece of evidence that will confirm their individual bias to prevent themselves from seeing a different perspective.

This can be anything from the artificially generated headlines from news websites, or the comments you read on the various tech oligarchs websites such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.

We already have factual evidence that every algorithm these individual websites give you are completely hijacked to swing you down the alt-right pipeline and control you by increasing your fear of the every day man.

Remember when we used to be able to have conversations with our neighbors, and the people at the grocery store? Well with heightened individualism we've all stopped being a community and now we're becoming these hyper individualistic radicalized people who see every person as a threat.

TikTok even shows you comments based on what your individual digital footprint is marked as. If you're conservative then they're going to show you conservative comments. If you're more left leaning then they'll show you more left leaning content.

Every single platform is working against you to ensure that you hate every team.

## Media Takeover

Every single media channel is owned by the same motherfuckers that are pitting everyone against one another and we're all just pawns in a much larger game for the billionaire oligarchs.

Don't believe me?

You're being exactly told what to think and you're not even challenging your own thought process and trying to find alternative viewpoints to challenge your own biases.

## Class Warfare

Now that they've convinced the entire working class of America that their neighbor is the enemy. We're all too distracted because we're told that whatever our neighbor is doing is totally and completely wrong so we should focus on that.

While we're distracted they're currently disassembling the government and picking the pockets of the American people and what is left of the country.

The end goal is to upheave all federally protected land and give it to Billionaire Oligarchs to create new decentralized sovereign patches. If you're unfamiliar with this concept a patch is an independent territory governed by a joint-stock corporation.

What I mean by this is that we are quickly being moved into a new type of Capitalism which is called techno-feudalism.

We will become the serfs in a new modern global agenda pushed by the World Economic Forum and the oligarchs will own everything from the land to the housing that you live in. You will absolutely own nothing and you will be happy.

## But Billionaires aren't the problem!?

If you're a sympathizer for these people I highly recommend you look at some videos about how much money these people actually have, and how much power they truly have.

Here's a few resources to educate yourself, and read carefully what these charts and graphs are trying to tell you.

These people could have solved various world scale problems ten times over, but their insane greed is preventing the world from becoming a much better place for us all. Everyone could have residency, food on the table, education, and have their medicinal needs met and they could still keep 3/4 of their wealth.

Yet we're told we are not working hard enough and that we should work harder. However, most of us are working harder than ever before. There are many of us who are holding multiple jobs, looking for side income streams, and much more.

Relative to what work life balance was like the 1960s and 70s we cannot live off a single person's income and support the traditional nuclear family. We're now required to have both adults working in the workforce, and also pay for childcare which is upwards of $3,000 a month per child.

## What's Happening Now?

Currently federal government employees who are civil servants to the United States constitution are being offered buyouts to retire. However, this wasn't Trump that issued this specific buyout request.

The exact messaging pushing people to take a buyout and retire was the exact same messaging that was utilized by Elon Musk when he took over Twitter / X.

These people are the first lines of defense to our country and they act as the checks and balances to resist giving up power to a foreign and domestic enemies. They are going to strip our great Nation of its National Parks, and sell our resources to the lowest bidder. That's why we're drilling oil, not refining it, and selling it to the lowest bidder so the oligarchs can continue to rob us blind.

While the revolution doesn't look violent, it's incredibly obvious that if enough of these people take the bait and resign we're going to be in big trouble.

## Hope.

While you may not believe it each generation is given an archetype with aligns with a set of patterns as well. Many of these oligarchs cannot run their systems without societies backbone. Which at this current point in time is held by a generation which has seen nothing but economic downturns and technological advancement.

That's right! Those good for nothing Millennials are marked as the hero generation for this crisis. When shit hits the fan we're the ones who know how to run the internet infrastructure and we're the ones controlling these systems from within.

We're the ones teaching the right minds how to wield power and resist at every angle. While it may seem like hope is quite grim in these trying times there's a very good chance that because a lot of Millennials have nothing left to lose we'll start pulling some of our own levers.

We're the generation who has given everyone the ability to print their own firearms.

We're the generation building a new decentralized internet that rips power from the oligarchs.

We're the generation who has the highest understanding of the global infrastructure that is utilized by these oligarchs.

We're the ones with enough grit to hold 3 or 4 jobs and still show up for work day in and day out.

The future is decentralized, but the people will be in control.
