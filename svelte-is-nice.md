# Svelte is Nice

I never got to experience any of the previous Svelte versions so this may be a hot take for a lot of people.

Anyway, I started learning Svelte this week and decided what better way to learn a language than to utilize it on my own personal website. Which has lead me to some very strong opinions about frameworks.

Let me explain my favorite things about Svelte so far.

## No Boilerplate Required

You kind of just start writing html markup and sprinkle in JavaScript where you need it.

This is so refreshing because everything just works instantly, and you get instant results.

## No Router Plugins

That's right, when you start using svelte the router is already there. You're ready to roll out of the box and you don't have to setup a bunch of stupid routing patterns.

## No Slug Plugins

When you create a page like `/blog/some-stupid-post` you don't have to do anything crazy to get it working. It also just works out of the box and it makes it so easy to build what you want to build without thinking about it.

## Clear Separation

I've mostly written single page applications that tap into server-side APIs, and Svelte is very clear about how you should make your queries and handle them. I don't have to introduce any crazy shit like Tanstack just to query some APIs.

## Less React Shit

One of the coolest things about Svelte is that it feels like its own language. You're not writing if/else statements inside of html markup and it just feels right. There's a clear and easy way to see what should render and what should not.

Even the for each statements aren't just an after-thought. Everything writes the exact same way.

## Conclusions

Basically, I'm probably going to continue using Svelte for everything in the future because it just feels like the right approach to complex web frameworks. This is a framework that is so simple and has just enough to get the job done.

Svelte is a love letter to those of us who are rejecting web frameworks, but don't want to fully commit to htmx.
