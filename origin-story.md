# Origin Story

I often don't like to reflect on my early years because I was an emotional kid that was never really understood by my parents or anyone around me. However, I think now is a better time than ever before to write these things down and talk about my upbringing.

When I was a child I grew up in Lake Arrowhead California until I was about 6 or 7. Lake Arrowhead was a bit of a weird experience for me as a kid because I remember running around the mountain streets and playing on playgrounds at abandoned houses in the back woods. I also remember playing in construction sites and riding my bike around on the dirt trails. Typical kid things.

Eventually we moved to a trailer park in the middle of the desert while my father was getting his 'dream home' constructed in the middle of the high desert in California. I had two little ramps that acted as a small skating area where I would go back and forth between the ramps. We were watching the Simpsons, Family Guy, etc. at night on my parents bed on the little small television.

When our home was finally constructed we moved in and it was a typical over the top middle class home with absurd amounts of space. I think the construction at the time cost around half a million. We had two cats Fritz and Dopey. Both of cats eventually ended up disappearing in the middle of the desert and were probably killed by coyotes or a larger bird.

If I'm recalling our grandfather got both my brother and I a couple of dirt bikes so we could ride them around our half acre yard and the desert. There were plenty of small tracks around the desert that were built by other riders and natural terrain. It was effectively a playground for shenanigans.

I think I have a love hate relationship with riding motorcycles these days because nothing sounds more freeing than being in the middle of the desert and riding a bike around. During this time was a lot of turmoil, my parents divorced and pretty much I became a bedroom kid. Which means I spent a majority of my time on the internet doing internet things.

I was absolutely god awful at all sports I played. It didn't matter how much a sport was shoved into my face, I did not have the coordination to do any of it. I know my Dad was really hoping for an amazing sports kid that would make him super proud but instead he got a giga computer nerd instead.

What kind of internet things you might ask? Well I spent a lot of time social engineering into other kids Facebook accounts and effectively hacking them. Additionally spent a lot of time on hack forums, planetrenders, pirating games, etc. I was envious of all the programmers and people that made the web tick.

I am going to leave a majority of the trauma out of this post, but if I did write about the trauma it would go right here in this specific spot right here. Yup this is the place for it.

I had no guardrails and I was an absolute menace. I did terrible in school and was sent to the 'alternative high school' which is where I was able to take my giant desktop computer into the class and work on the senior video in exchange for good grades. It was a strange endeavor but it effectively made me a better kid by just letting me sit on my computer and fiddle around.

After my parents divorced we moved out to Lake Havasu in Arizona where I was participating in LAN Parties and playing a lot of games. This is where most of my grades went off of the deep end because I was effectively stuck in a house and my mom was busy with her boyfriend at the time. I spent a good chunk of this time chugging soda, playing league of legends, and playing San Andreas Multiplayer servers like Next Generation Gaming.

I got a little bit of experience with 3D modeling and exposure to writing decent little stories and developing characters while I was out there. As a fun little thing I remember being in the back of a car and my buddy Stephen drove his car onto the local golf course and did donuts. Shenanigans...

I participated in some region-wide web design competition in Arizona and we did pretty alright but floundered at the state level. Which is fine because I was too immature to understand any of it. I even tried to take a Java class at the time to build Minecraft plugins but I was too stupid to understand it.

Eventually I wound up back at my dads but he was living in San Bernardino at the time. His current wife was constantly cutting the internet from me and preventing me from accessing the one and only thing that was true to me. It frustrated the absolute hell out of me and I still think about it constantly.

I was eventually just given a job doing dishwashing at a restaraunt in Redlands, CA and that's where I spent about 7 years moving from dish washing to food prep and then to serving tables. A good chunk of my early years at that job was commuting 2 hours by bus. I had a roommate when I finally moved out on my own and I spent a good portion of that time sleeping on an indoor hammock and speedrunning the Wolfenstein 2009 game.

I made a website for that restaraunt and they gave me about $2,000 for it. I was also given a bike but that was stolen at some point off of the second story of the apartment complex I was living at. No idea how that happened but it still blows my mind.

I had to get my own apartment at some point but just kept hopping between apartments in the same area. I met my wife when she effectively inserted herself into my life and started giving me rides home from work. I would otherwise get myself around by transporting myself on a longboard to and from work. I almost never bought food from the grocery store and exclusively lived off of my one employee meal when I had a shift. Otherwise I would eat 2 chipotle burritos or like 7 tacos from Rosa Marias.

I spent a good chunk of my time staying up for 24 hours just learning how to code. Learning how to do 3D in 3DS max and streaming on Twitch. I made multiple Fallout 4 mods during this time but was also doing things for San Andreas Multiplayer like designing my own skins for the 3D models.

I also spent a very large chunk of my time during this time reflecting on myself and the world around me. I watched as my principles and my values were completely unaligned from my parents. I also saw the world for what it was and that's what has defined my values as a person today. Empathy is a strong point for me but it's hard for me to show empathy when most of the time because I'm so broken. If I could fix all of my friends problems with a pocketbook I would.

I was finally able to get a grasp on programming around 23 and the rest was history for me.
